These PDFs contain basic information on law firms across the country including lawyer demographics, general practice area, hiring information, and compensation and benefits. This is sourced from nalpdirectory.com. 

We were interested in a subset of this data: General Practice Areas, number of partners, number of counsel, sumber of associates, number of entry-level placements last year, number of non-traditional track/staff attorneys, and the firm's organizational narrative. 

In order to scrape the data into a structured dataframe, I used PyPDF2 and re python libraries.
